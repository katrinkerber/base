  <blockquote>
      <p>Every line of code should appear to be written by a single person, no matter the number of contributors.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Basic editor preferences</h2>
    <p>Set your editor to the following settings to avoid common code inconsistencies and dirty diffs:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use soft-tabs set to <strong>2 spaces</strong>. They're the only way to guarantee code renders the same in any environment.</li>
    <li>Trim trailing white space on save.</li>
    <li>Set encoding to UTF-8.</li>
    <li>Add new line at end of files.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you are using <strong>Sublime Text 2</strong>, have a look at these <a href="https://gist.github.com/katrinkerber/d471b3f995f80f48117c">settings</a>.</p>

  <h2>Best practices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Strive to maintain HTML standards and semantics, but not at the expense of practicality. Use the least amount of markup with the fewest intricacies whenever possible.</li>
    <li>Break down CSS into modular components instead of pages. Pages can be rearranged and components moved.</li>
    <li>Restirct the number of dependencies required. Any code maintained by a third-party has the potential to cause inconsistencies in your own code.</li>
    <li>Think and work with progressive enhancement in mind at all times.</li>
    <li>Comment your code whenever possible, even if it seems excessive, cumbersome or obvious at times. Your future self and fellow developers will thank you.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Preprocessors and version control</h2>
