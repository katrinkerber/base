  <p>Code has been indented using spaces with a tab-width of two.</p>
  <p>Sass files are combined to <em>styles.min.css</em> using <a href="http://incident57.com/codekit/">CodeKit</a>.</p>
  <p>CSS is written following the mobile-first approach, declaring styles for small viewports first and then making adjustments for larger viewports.</p>
  
  <p>The <em>scripts.js</em> file is set up in <a href="http://incident57.com/codekit/">CodeKit</a> to import all used plugins at the top and is then concatenated and minified to <em>scripts.min.js</em>.</p>
